## So why build a Tic Tac Toe Game, when there are literally so many places where we can play it?

Two reasons - 

1. It's fun
2. If you are a beginner in the Python Programming language you get to practice a lot of concepts like 
   - Lists
   - Functions
   - Conditional Statements
   - String Formatting
   - Loops


## Divide this project into these steps - 

1. Print the board
2. Store the moves
3. Take user input
4. Check if game is over
5. Print the winner if there's one
